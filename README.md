1. List of expenses/incomes by category with possibility to add new items
2. There must be some charts for visualizing the data (could be by category or if incomes cover expenses)

sould be done in React. For state management you can choose Hooks or Redux.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
